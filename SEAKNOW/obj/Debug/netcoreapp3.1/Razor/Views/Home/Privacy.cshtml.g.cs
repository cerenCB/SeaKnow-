    Today, it is possible to see the elements of the information society in all areas of life. Most people now have a smartphone in their pockets, most people have a computer at home, and all companies have information technology management units in their back offices. However, the information itself is not that visible. However, only half a century after computers entered human life, the amount of information began to be collected in a meaningful and special way. Nowadays, not only the amount of information has increased, but also the speed of accessing information has increased. Quantitative change has brought qualitative change with it. The collection of data to form a meaningful whole took place first in the field of astronomy and genetics. The concept of big data was first used in these fields, and then this concept was used for each field. Big data has started to show itself in every aspect of our lives. For example; From the internet search engine Google, we come across big data in every fie");
            WriteLiteral(@"ld, from diagnosis and treatment of diseases to online shopping. [1]

    Big data; It is the form of converting all data collected from various sources such as social media posts, blogs, blogs, photographs, videos, and log files into a meaningful and processable form. As usual, it is an unstructured data collection that remains outside of the structured data kept in relational databases and has not been used much until recently. According to the widespread computing belief that is now demolished, unstructured data was worthless, but big data showed us something that is the only system that is enormously important, usable, useful, that is, that has led to the emergence of treasure from the garbage dump today. Big data; It consists of a large amount of information such as web server logs, Internet statistics, social media publications, blogs, microblogs, information from climate sensors and similar sensors, call logs from GSM operators.

    When big data is interpreted with the right analysis methods, it can ");
            WriteLiteral(@"enable companies to make strategic decisions, to better manage their risks and to innovate.

    Most of the companies continue to make decisions based on the data they obtain through conventional data warehouse and data mining methods. However, dynamically predicting consumer trends requires analyzing big data and acting on these analyzes. Big data is a term that includes many issues such as the creation, storage, flow and analysis of this big data, which is difficult to process with traditional database tools and algorithms. As the data is too large to handle conventional databases, the growth rate of the data also exceeds a computer or a data storage unit. With 2012 figures, 2.5 Kentirillion bytes of data are produced daily in the world. All of the tasks such as processing and transferring big data of this scale are called Big Data.

    Today's databases are not enough to keep data growing of this scale. While relational databases can hold data at gigabyte level, we can store data at petabyte levels with ");
            WriteLiteral(@"large data. However, big data is only suitable for batch processing (Batch) operations. There are no critical features in advanced databases such as Transactions. Since databases can perform operations such as reading, writing and updating through transactions, these transactions are considered atomic and with various locking mechanisms, data is prevented from becoming inconsistent by changing it by more than one transaction. It should be used in cases where big data is written once and read repeatedly. Because data is processed in multiple locations in parallel. Data of this size are produced in many areas from RFID sensors to social media and hospitals. Big data is a necessity in many areas where data is given, especially the analysis of DNA sequences and data from weather sensors.
